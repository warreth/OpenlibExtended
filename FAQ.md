## Is using this app legal? Will I get in trouble for downloading books?
Accessing copyrighted material without permission may be illegal in your country. **This app is provided for educational purposes only. Please check your local laws and use responsibly.**

**However, it is very, very unlikely that anyone will punish you simply for downloading a book.**  
When you download a book from a shadow library like Anna’s Archive, there isn’t any public record of your activity, and there are currently no known systems for tracking or flagging individual downloaders.  
As long as you’re just downloading for personal use and not distributing or uploading copyrighted material, the chances of facing legal consequences are extremely low.

> **Note:** Ultimately, you are responsible for your own actions and privacy. We encourage users to stay informed and exercise caution according to their local laws.
